- Stopped having a `CSNodeSiblings` class because no use for it yet
	- Switched from `CSNodeSiblings().add()` to `CSNode().create$Child()`
- Made everything possible a getter method because it's easier to track that way
- Stopped doing `.create$Child()` in base class constructor because child classes may have different behavior on create
- Having a getter for `CSNode().children` caused a stack overflow
- Have to use o.before to populate suite-wide variables. ospec runs through the whole script first, then runs through each test, so if a variable is populated outside of a test, unexpected things happen.
- Have to put .forEach inside tests, can't put tests inside .forEach, for similar reason to above
